  <p>Prior to Crossfit, Samantha Briggs was a Manchester Firefighter. In addition, she was a triathalon competitor and avid runner. She's well known in the Crossfit world for her engine. She <em>thrives</em> at those long workouts. Where others tire, she only moves faster.</p>
  <p>During the 2016 Reebok Crossfit Games, she announced to her fellow athletes and the world that it would be her last appearance at the Games. I know I personally will miss her in the sport. Her ability to go into that dark place and endure those long grinds has always been something I admire. Not only that, but she has always seemed to be a class act in the sport, willing to coach and mentor other athletes, stating time and time again the need to enjoy what you do and to have fun doing it. Though they'll be glad not to have to compete on the same floor with her, I know her other competitors will miss having her there at the future Crossfit Games.</p>
